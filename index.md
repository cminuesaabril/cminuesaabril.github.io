I am a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](http://matematicas.unex.es/) of the [University of Extremadura](https://www.unex.es/?set_language=en&cl=en), in Badajoz (Spain). My research is focused on branching processes, especially in controlled branching processes.

I am a member of the research group [Branching Processes and Their Applications](http://branching.unex.es/). Currently, I am in the final year of my PhD studies, for which I was awarded a University Professor Training grant (Predoctoral FPU), given by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. I also completed a BSc in Mathematics (2012), a BSc in Statistics (2012), a MSc in Science Research (2013) and a MSc in Formation of Teachers of Secondary Education (2014), in both of which my specialisation was Mathematics.
